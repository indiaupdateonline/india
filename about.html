                    <h2>Our Vision</h2>
                    <p>
                        The Indian Literature Archive was born from a simple yet profound realization: India’s literary tradition, stretching back more than three millennia, remains scattered across fragile manuscripts, temple libraries, rare academic collections, and oral memory. While some of these works have been translated, annotated, and studied by scholars, an overwhelming majority remain inaccessible to students, researchers, and general readers across the globe. Our vision is to make this collective heritage available in English, while respecting the depth, nuance, and cultural grounding of the original texts.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This archive is not just a repository of ancient and medieval texts, but a living bridge between the past and the present. It is a commitment to preservation, accessibility, and interpretation. The archive aims to ensure that Sanskrit hymns, Tamil epics, Prakrit romances, medieval bhakti poetry, Sufi treatises, folk ballads, and early scientific treatises can be discovered, studied, and celebrated in a unified, digital-first environment.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                    <p>
                        The mission of the Indian Literature Archive is threefold:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Preservation:</strong> To digitally safeguard texts that are at risk of being forgotten, ensuring that centuries-old works are not lost to decay or neglect.</li>
                        <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> To provide authentic English translations and commentaries for a global audience, without paywalls or restrictions.</li>
                        <li><strong>Education:</strong> To create a platform that can serve school students, university scholars, and general enthusiasts equally, by offering reliable translations, glossaries, and contextual essays.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Why This Archive Matters</h2>
                    <p>
                        Literature in India has never been merely a pastime. It has been a vehicle of philosophy, religion, politics, law, astronomy, medicine, and ethics. Every region, language, and community contributed voices to a grand symphony of texts. Sanskrit epics framed moral universes; Tamil Sangam poems captured human emotions with striking realism; Sufi qawwalis merged music with mysticism; Bhakti poetry broke social hierarchies through devotion; folk tales preserved wisdom in accessible form.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Without translations and scholarly frameworks, many of these voices risk becoming inaudible in the modern world. Our archive exists to amplify them.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Our Journey</h2>
                    <p>
                        The Indian Literature Archive officially launched in 2025 as an independent non-profit initiative. It emerged after years of groundwork by scholars, librarians, and digital archivists who recognized the absence of a unified platform dedicated to India’s ancient and medieval texts. While many excellent translation projects exist, they are often confined to specific languages, universities, or publishers. We envisioned a more holistic space where Sanskrit could converse with Urdu, where medieval Odia could stand beside Prakrit, and where a Tamil epic could be explored in continuity with its Kannada counterpart.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The journey is just beginning. At launch, the archive already holds over 3,500 translated works across 14 languages. Each text has been curated with academic rigor, citing translation sources, editions, and critical apparatus. As the archive expands, we are committed to adding newly translated works, multimedia resources, and partnerships with academic institutions worldwide.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Core Values</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Authenticity:</strong> All translations and commentaries are drawn from scholarly or peer-reviewed sources, ensuring reliability.</li>
                        <li><strong>Plurality:</strong> India’s literature is multilingual, multi-religious, and multi-regional. We respect and represent this diversity without privileging one tradition over another.</li>
                        <li><strong>Openness:</strong> The archive is open-access, designed for both the specialist and the curious reader.</li>
                        <li><strong>Sustainability:</strong> We follow open standards for digital preservation, ensuring texts remain available for future generations.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Our Team</h2>
                    <p>
                        Behind this archive is a collective of scholars, linguists, translators, digital humanists, and technologists. The founding team includes professors from leading Indian and international universities, software developers passionate about cultural preservation, and young researchers bringing fresh perspectives.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Editorial Board:</strong> A panel of senior scholars in Sanskrit, Tamil, Prakrit, Hindi, and comparative literature oversee the quality of translations and annotations.  
                        <br>
                        <strong>Technical Team:</strong> Engineers and designers ensure that the website is fast, accessible, and intuitive.  
                        <br>
                        <strong>Contributors:</strong> Graduate students, researchers, and independent scholars contribute translations, bibliographies, and contextual essays.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Partnerships</h2>
                    <p>
                        The Indian Literature Archive collaborates with libraries, archives, and universities. We work with digitization projects to source reliable scans of manuscripts. We partner with publishers to license translations for open-access use. We collaborate with cultural organizations that share our vision of making literature accessible globally.
                    </p>

                    <h2>How We Work</h2>
                    <p>
                        Every text in the archive undergoes a process:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Collection:</strong> Identification of primary texts and available translations.</li>
                        <li><strong>Verification:</strong> Cross-checking translations with original texts and scholarly commentaries.</li>
                        <li><strong>Digitization:</strong> Encoding the text in accessible formats (HTML, JSON, EPUB, PDF).</li>
                        <li><strong>Annotation:</strong> Adding introductions, glossaries, and cross-references to aid understanding.</li>
                        <li><strong>Publication:</strong> Making the text freely available online with citations and metadata.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
                    <p>
                        Our roadmap includes expanding to 20+ languages, integrating multimedia content (audio recitations, video lectures, interactive maps), and building tools for comparative study. We aim to create thematic collections—such as “Women in Medieval Indian Literature,” “Bhakti and Sufi Dialogues,” “Science in Sanskrit Texts”—that allow readers to explore across boundaries of language and period.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Invitation to Collaborate</h2>
                    <p>
                        The Indian Literature Archive is a collective effort. We invite translators, scholars, educators, students, and enthusiasts to contribute. Whether it is through submitting translations, writing essays, volunteering with digitization, or supporting financially, every contribution strengthens this initiative.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>
                        This archive is more than a digital library. It is a cultural mission: to ensure that the wisdom, beauty, and diversity of Indian literature remain accessible to generations yet unborn. We believe that every verse of the Rigveda, every couplet of Kabir, every lyric of Andal, and every Sufi ghazal is a thread in the vast tapestry of human civilization. Preserving them, translating them, and sharing them is not only a scholarly duty but also a moral responsibility.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We thank you for visiting, exploring, and supporting the Indian Literature Archive. Together, let us continue this journey of rediscovery.
